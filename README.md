My personal Mac setup

## Install Homebrew
can be installed from: https://brew.sh
Then install wget as described at the website and maybe flutter via fvm docs: https://fvm.app

## Install required application
Install applications like XCode from Appstore and VSCode, Android Studio from the webiste

## Git setup
1. Get an access token from the github.com website for your account, Mac will for now auto remember the token so no need to keep a copy. This also will work for VSCode
2. To use github from VSCode, you need to setup username and email in config. Config log will show you how after you try ro commit from VSCode
3. Setup fvm for VSCode
